this small app is intended to visually force users to doubt.
Whether we see others or maybe we are projecting parts of our image onto others?
Or maybe we can only find ourselves trough our distorted reflections in others?

Idea for such visual interpretation of said question came to me during "Intermedia" classes 

To run the app just copy files from main branch and create python environment (venv)
Installation:
1 copy files to Your folder

2 create virtual environment

cd /path/to/fplder/FaceOFFrelease
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/MacOS
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt

3 to run the app:

python FaceOFF-1.0.py
